## Concurrent Computing Tutorials

A bit of terminology before we start discussing parallel and distributed computing paradigms on the DNAnexus Platform.

There are many definitions and approaches to tackling the concept of parallelization and distributing workloads in the cloud (Here's a [particularly helpful Stack Exchange post](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/1580/distributed-vs-parallel-computing) on the subject). To help make this documentation easier to understand, when discussing concurrent computing paradigms we'll refer to:
* **Parallel**: Using multiple threads or logical cores to concurrently process a workload.
* **Distributed**: Using multiple machines (in our case instances in the cloud) that communicate to concurrently process a workload.

Keep these formal definitions in mind as you read through the tutorials.
