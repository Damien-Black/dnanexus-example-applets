Developers new to the [DNAnexus platform](https://platform.dnanexus.com/login) may find it easier to learn by doing. This page contains a collection of simple [tutorials]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials.html %}) and [examples]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link example-applets.html %}) intended to showcase common tasks and methodologies when creating an app(let) on the DNAnexus platform. After reading through the tutorials and examples you should be able to develop app(let)s that:
- **Run efficiently**: make use of cloud computing methodologies.
- **Are easy to debug**: let developers understand and resolve issues.
- **Use the scale of the cloud**: take advantage of the DNAnexus platform's flexibility
- **Are easy to use**: reduce support and enable collaboration.

The Getting Started series will introduce terms and concepts that tutorials and examples will build upon. If it's your first time developing an app(let) be sure to read through the ["Getting started"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-02-08-overview.md %}) series first.

#### [Tutorials]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials.html %})

The [Tutorials]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials.html %}) pages are not meant to show realistic everyday examples, but rather provide a strong starting point for app(let) developers.

#### [Examples]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link example-applets.html %})

A user seeking realistic applications can find DNAnexus developed app(let)s in the [Examples pages]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link example-applets.html %}) or in the [Developer Applets](https://platform.dnanexus.com/projects/B406G0x2fz2B3GVk65200003/data/) resource project.
