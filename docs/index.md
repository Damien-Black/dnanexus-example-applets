Developers new to the [DNAnexus platform](https://platform.dnanexus.com/login) may find it easier to learn by doing. This page contains a collection of simple [tutorials]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials.html %}) and examples intended to showcase common tasks and methodologies when creating an app(let) on the DNAnexus platform. After reading through the tutorials and examples you should be able to develop app(let)s that:
- **Run efficiently**: make use of cloud computing methodologies.
- **Are easy to debug**: let developers understand and resolve issues.
- **Use the scale of the cloud**: take advantage of the DNAnexus platform's flexibility
- **Are easy to use**: reduce support and enable collaboration.

If it's your first time developing an app(let) be sure to read through the [Getting started]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-02-08-overview.md %}) series. This series will introduce terms and concepts that tutorials and examples will build upon.

The [Tutorials]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link tutorials.html %}) page is not meant to show realistic everyday examples, but rather provide a strong starting point for app(let) developers. Tutorials will showcase simple and varied implementations of the SAMtools view command on the DNAnexus platform.
