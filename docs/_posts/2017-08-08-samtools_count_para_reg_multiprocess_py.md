title: Parallel by Region (py)
type: Document
---
This applet tutorial will perform a SAMtools count using parallel threads.

In order to take full advantage of the scalability that cloud computing offers, our scripts have to implement the correct methodologies. This applet tutorial will:
1. Install SAMtools
2. Download BAM file
3. Split workload
4. Count Regions in Parallel

This applet tutorial code is extremely similar to the [_Parallel Threads SAMtools count tutorial_](/python_parallel_tutorial.html#samtools_count_para_chr_subprocess_py), except `multiprocessing` is used instead of `multiprocessing.dummy`.

## How is SAMtools dependency provided?
SAMtools dependency is resolved by declaring an [Apt-Get](https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/apt-get.html) package in the dxapp.json runSpec.execDepends.
```json
{
  "runSpec": {
    ...
    "execDepends": [
      {"name": "samtools"}
    ]
  }
```
For additional information, please refer to the [execDepends wiki page](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Execution-Environment-Reference#Software-Packages).

## Download Inputs

This applet downloads all inputs at once using `dxpy.download_all_inputs`:
```python
inputs = dxpy.download_all_inputs()
# download_all_inputs returns a dictionary that contains mapping from inputs to file locations.
# Additionaly, helper keys, value pairs are added to the dicitonary, similar to bash helper functions
inputs
#     mappings_sorted_bam_path: [u'/home/dnanexus/in/mappings_sorted_bam/SRR504516.bam']
#     mappings_sorted_bam_name: u'SRR504516.bam'
#     mappings_sorted_bam_prefix: u'SRR504516'
#     mappings_sorted_bai_path: u'/home/dnanexus/in/mappings_sorted_bai/SRR504516.bam.bai'
#     mappings_sorted_bai_name: u'SRR504516.bam.bai'
#     mappings_sorted_bai_prefix: u'SRR504516'
```
## Split workload
We parallely process by using the convenient python `multiprocessing` module. A rather simple pattern you can follow to parallely compute:
```python
print "Number of cpus: {0}".format(cpu_count())  # Get cpu count from multiprocessing
worker_pool = Pool(processes=cpu_count())  # Create a pool of workers, 1 for each core
results = worker_pool.map(run_cmd, view_cmds)  # map run_cmds to a collection
                                               # Pool.map will handle orchestrating the job
worker_pool.close()
worker_pool.join()  # Make sure to close and join workers when done
```
This convenient pattern allows you to quickly orchestrate jobs on a worker. For more detailed overview of the `multiprocessing` module visit the [python2.7 docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html)

We create several helpers in our applet script to split run process our workload. One helper you may have seen before is `run_cmd`, we use this function to manage or subprocess calls:
```python
def run_cmd(cmd_arr):
    """Run shell command.
    Helper function to simplify the pool.map() call in our parallelization.
    Raises OSError if command specified (index 0 in cmd_arr) isn't valid
    """
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        cmd_arr,
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
    exit_code = proc.returncode
    proc_tuple = (stdout, stderr, exit_code)
    return proc_tuple
```

Before we can split our workload, we need to know what regions are present in our BAM input file. We handle this initial parsing in the `parse_sam_header_for_region` function:
```python
def parse_sam_header_for_region(bamfile_path):
    """Helper function to match SN regions contained in SAM header

    Returns:
        regions (list[string]): list of regions in bam header
    """
    header_cmd = ['samtools', 'view', '-H', bamfile_path]
    print 'parsing SAM headers:', " ".join(header_cmd)
    headers_str = subprocess.check_output(header_cmd)
    rgx = re.compile(r'SN:(\S+)\s')
    regions = rgx.findall(headers_str)
    return regions
```

Once our workload is split and we've started processing we wait and review the status of each `Pool` worker. Then we merge and output our results.
```python
# Write results to file
resultfn = inputs['mappings_sorted_bam_name'][0]
resultfn = (
    resultfn[:-4] + '_count.txt'
    if resultfn.endswith(".bam")
    else resultfn + '_count.txt')
with open(resultfn, 'w') as f:
    sum_reads = 0
    for res, reg in izip(results, regions):
        read_count = int(res[0])
        sum_reads += read_count
        f.write("Region {0}: {1}\n".format(reg, read_count))
    f.write("Total reads: {0}".format(sum_reads))

count_file = dxpy.upload_local_file(resultfn)
output = {}
output["count_file"] = dxpy.dxlink(count_file)
return output
```

{% include note.html content="The `run_cmd` function return a tuple containing the stdout, stderr, and exit code of the subprocess call. We parse these outputs from our workers to determine a failed or a passed run." %}
```python
def verify_pool_status(proc_tuples):
    """
    Helper to verify worker succeeded.

    As failed commands are detected we write the stderr from that command
    to the job_error.json file. This file will be printed to the platform
    job log on App failure.
    """
    all_succeed = True
    err_msgs = []
    for proc in proc_tuples:
        if proc[2] != 0:
            all_succeed = False
            err_msgs.append(proc[1])
    if err_msgs:
        raise dxpy.exceptions.AppInternalError("\n".join(err_msgs))
```
